            <h2>Opsec, Privacy, and Schizomaxxing</h2>
            <p>figured this will make an ok first blog post, here are some of the tools and things i do for opsec:</p>
        <h2>the tor network</h2>Tor is an overlay network that allows anonymity and access to the darknet, but i use it to proxy my apps through it including discord.<br> 
        I came through a lot of problems while using the tor for anonymity mainly with cloudflare or ratelimits, especially on discord.<br><br>
        I even got my account locked once because i proxy discord through it, but i will still always use it :)<br><br>
        you could achieve this by either using torsocks (cli), or running a tor SOCKS proxy once you have that setup you can simply do the following<br>
        i'll use vesktop because it's the cutest discord client or something<br><br>

        <br> <span style="background-color:black;color:lightblue;">exec electron31 /usr/lib/vesktop/app.asar --proxy-server="socks5://localhost:9050" $VESKTOP_USER_FLAGS "$@"</span>
            <br>
            or something along the lines
            <br>
